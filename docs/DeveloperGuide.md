## Design

### Architecture

The **Architecture Diagram** below gives a high-level overview of LinuxLingo.

![Architecture Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml)

**Main components of the architecture:**

`LinuxLingo` (the main class) is in charge of app launch. At startup, it:

- Extracts bundled question bank resources to disk (via `ResourceExtractor`).
- Loads the `QuestionBank` from `data/questions/`.
- Creates the shared `VirtualFileSystem`, `ShellSession`, and `ExamSession`.
- Delegates to `MainParser` for interactive mode, or handles one-shot CLI commands directly.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following components:

| Component | Responsibility |
| --------- | -------------- |
| **CLI** | Handles user I/O (`Ui`) and top-level command dispatch (`MainParser`). |
| **Shell** | Parses and executes shell commands in a simulated Linux environment. |
| **Exam** | Manages exam sessions — question presentation, answer checking, scoring. |
| **Storage** | Reads/writes data on the real file system (question banks, VFS snapshots). |
| **VFS** | In-memory virtual file system that all shell commands operate on. |

**How the components interact with each other:**

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions when the user launches the app in interactive mode and types `shell`:

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml)

---

### CLI Component

The CLI component consists of two classes: `Ui` and `MainParser`.

![CLI Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/CliClassDiagram.puml)

**`Ui`** is the single point of contact for all user-facing I/O. It wraps `Scanner` for input and `PrintStream` for output and error streams. All components use `Ui` instead of directly calling `System.in`/`System.out`/`System.err`, making testing easier (injectable streams).

**`MainParser`** implements the top-level REPL loop. It reads user input and dispatches to one of: `shell` (enter Shell Simulator), `exam` (start an exam), `exec` (one-shot shell command), `help`, or `exit`/`quit`.

---

### Shell Component

The Shell component handles command parsing, execution, and the interactive REPL. It is the largest component in LinuxLingo.

The following class diagram shows the key classes. For clarity, only representative command implementations are shown; the full set of 35 commands follows the same `Command` interface.

![Shell Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ShellClassDiagram.puml)

The Shell component:

- Uses `ShellParser` to tokenize and parse raw input into a `ParsedPlan` (a list of `Segment` objects connected by operators).
- `ShellSession` iterates through segments, looking up each command name in `CommandRegistry`, executing them, and chaining results via pipes, `&&`, `||`, or `;`.
- Before command lookup, `ShellSession` resolves aliases, expands combined flags (e.g., `-la` → `-l -a`), expands glob patterns against the VFS, and expands shell variables (`$USER`, `$HOME`, `$PWD`).
- `ShellLineReader` and `ShellCompleter` provide JLine-based tab-completion and command history support for the interactive shell.
- Each `Command` implementation receives the current `ShellSession` (for VFS access and session state), parsed arguments, and optional piped stdin. It returns a `CommandResult` containing stdout, stderr, and an exit code.

**Supported commands (35 total):**

| Category | Commands |
| -------- | -------- |
| Navigation | `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` |
| File Operations | `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `echo`, `diff`, `tee` |
| Text Processing | `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq` |
| Permissions | `chmod` |
| Information | `man`, `tree`, `which`, `whoami`, `date` |
| Alias & History | `alias`, `unalias`, `history` |
| Environment | `save`, `load`, `reset`, `envlist`, `envdelete` |
| Utility | `help`, `clear` |

---

### Exam Component

The Exam component handles question presentation, answer checking, and score tracking.

![Exam Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ExamClassDiagram.puml)

The Exam component:

- `QuestionBank` loads question data files from `data/questions/` (via `QuestionParser`) and organizes them by topic.
- `ExamSession` orchestrates exam sessions with three entry points: interactive mode, direct CLI args, and single-random-question mode.
- `QuestionInteraction` handles all user interaction for non-PRAC questions: printing the question, reading the answer, showing feedback, and recording the outcome.
- `RandomQuestionMode` handles the single-random-question mode: picks one random question from any topic and presents it.
- Three question types are supported: `McqQuestion` (multiple choice), `FitbQuestion` (fill in the blank), and `PracQuestion` (practical — verified by checking VFS state against `Checkpoint` objects).
- `ExamResult` tracks per-question outcomes and computes scores.

---

### Storage Component

The Storage component handles all real disk I/O operations.

![Storage Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml)

The Storage component:

- `Storage` provides static utility methods for file read/write, directory creation, and path management. All persistent data lives under `data/`.
- `VfsSerializer` converts VFS snapshots to/from a custom `.env` text format, enabling users to save and load shell environments.
- `QuestionParser` parses `.txt` question bank files into `Question` objects using a pipe-delimited format.
- `ResourceExtractor` copies bundled question bank files from the JAR to `data/questions/` on first run.
- `StorageException` is a checked exception thrown when a storage I/O operation fails, used by `Storage`, `VfsSerializer`, and other components.

---

### VFS (Virtual File System) Component

The VFS component provides an in-memory simulated Linux file system.

![VFS Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/VfsClassDiagram.puml)

Key design decisions for VFS:

- **All path operations go through `VirtualFileSystem`** — shell commands never use `java.io` or `java.nio.file` for simulated files. This ensures a fully isolated, deterministic simulation.
- The VFS uses a **tree structure** of `FileNode` objects. `Directory` holds a `LinkedHashMap` of children for ordered, O(1) lookup by name.
- **`Permission`** models Unix 9-character permission strings (`rwxr-xr-x`), supporting both octal and symbolic notation for `chmod`.
- **`deepCopy()`** is provided at every level (VFS, Directory, RegularFile) to enable snapshot-based features (e.g., creating a temp VFS for PRAC exam questions, saving environments).
- The default VFS tree contains `/home/user`, `/tmp`, and `/etc` (with a `hostname` file).

The following object diagram illustrates a concrete VFS state after the user has created a file `hello.txt` under `/home/user`:

![VFS Object Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/VfsObjectDiagram.puml)

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Shell Parsing and Execution

The shell parsing pipeline transforms the raw user input string like `echo hello | grep h > out.txt` into a structured execution plan (`ParsedPlan`) that the execution engine can act on. Understanding this pipeline is essential before working on any feature that involves parsing or command execution.

#### Parsing Pipeline Overview: (High Level)

![Parsing Pipeline Activity Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ParsingPipelineActivity.puml)

The `ShellParser.parse()` method runs the input through two stages: **tokenization**, then **plan building**

![Shell Parser Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ShellParserSequence.puml)

#### Stage 1: Tokenization

The tokenizer reads the input one character at a time using a state machine with three states:

| State | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `NORMAL` | Accumulates characters into tokens; whitespace flushes the current token. Special characters (` \| `, `>`, `>>`, `&&`, `;`) produce operator tokens. Quote characters switch state. |
| `IN_SINGLE_QUOTE` | All characters are literal until the closing `'` |
| `IN_DOUBLE_QUOTE` | All characters are literal until the closing `"` |

After tokenization, the token list is split into `Segment` objects at inter-segment operators (`PIPE`, `AND`, `SEMICOLON` , `OR`).
Within each segment, `REDIRECT` / `APPEND` / `INPUT_REDIRECT` tokens consume the next `WORD` token as the redirect target file.

The parser handles two lookahead cases during tokenization in `NORMAL` state: `||` and `>>` are
distinguished from `|` and `>` by peeking at the next character before emitting a token.

A lone `&` character (not followed by another `&`) is treated as a literal word character
rather than an operator, which matches standard shell behaviour.

> **Note:** Single-quoted tokens (e.g. `'*.txt'`) are marked with a `\0` prefix by the tokenizer (`SINGLE_QUOTE_MARKER`). This flag is checked by `expandGlobs()` and `expandVariables()` to suppress expansion, matching standard shell behaviour. The marker is stripped before the argument reaches the command.

#### Stage 2: Plan Building

Once the flat token list is produced, `buildPlan()` walks through it and groups tokens into `Segment` objects. Each `Segment` holds a command name, its arguments, and optional redirect information. Operator tokens (`PIPE`, `AND`, `SEMICOLON`, `OR`) act as delimiters between segments and are recorded separately in the `operators` list.

The parser maintains an `Expecting` flag to handle redirect targets: when a `REDIRECT` or `APPEND` token is seen, the very next `WORD` token is consumed as the redirect file path rather than as a command argument. The same pattern applies to `INPUT_REDIRECT` (`<`).

The result is a `ParsedPlan` with the following invariant, enforced by an assertion:

> `operators.size()` is always exactly `segments.size() - 1`

This means a plan with three segments always has exactly two operators connecting them, making the execution engine's iteration straightforward.

Class Diagram

![ParsedPlan Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ParsedPlanClassDiagram.puml)

#### Execution engine (`ShellSession.runPlan()`)

All parsing ultimately feeds into `runPlan()`, the core method that iterates the `ParsedPlan` and chains commands together. It is worth understanding its structure because most enhancements to the shell (new operators, alias resolution, input redirect) are implemented here.

The engine tracks two pieces of state across iterations: `pipedStdin` (the stdout of the previous command, forwarded when the operator was `PIPE`) and `lastExitCode` (used to evaluate `&&` and `||` conditions). The loop processes one `Segment` per iteration:

**runPlan() Sequence Diagram:**

![Run Plan Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/RunPlanSequence.puml)

#### Key Behaviour:
Exit propagation: The `shouldExit()` flag on `CommandResult` causes `runPlan()` to set  
  `running = false` and break the loop immediately.

---
#### Execution walkthrough: `echo hello | grep h > output.txt`

**Stage 1 (Tokenization):** produces the flat token list:

| # | Value | Type |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | `echo` | WORD |
| 2 | `hello` | WORD |
| 3 | `\|` | PIPE |
| 4 | `grep` | WORD |
| 5 | `h` | WORD |
| 6 | `>` | REDIRECT |
| 7 | `output.txt` | WORD |

**Stage 2 (Plan building):** splits on the PIPE and consumes `output.txt`
as a redirect target, yielding a `ParsedPlan` with:
- Segment 1: `echo [hello]`, no redirect
- Segment 2: `grep [h]`, redirect `> output.txt`
- Operator: `[PIPE]`

**Stage 3 (Execution):** (`runPlan()`): the sequence diagram below shows
how `ShellSession` orchestrates the two segments. Key points to note:
- `echo`'s stdout (`"hello"`) is forwarded as `pipedStdin` to `grep`
- After `grep` executes, its stdout is written to `output.txt` via the
  VFS rather than printed to the terminal (the result is replaced with
  an empty success)


![Echo Grep Pipe Execution Sequence](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/EchoGrepPipeSequence.puml)

<!-- When a command name is not found in the registry, `runPlan()` calls `suggestCommand()`
before printing the error. This method computes the Levenshtein edit distance between
the mistyped input and every registered command name, returning a "Did you mean 'X'?"
hint if the closest match is within distance 2. Glob patterns in arguments (containing
`*` or `?`) are expanded against the VFS via `expandGlobs()` before the command receives
them, if no VFS paths match the pattern, the literal argument is passed through unchanged. -->
---
**Operator semantics:**

| Operator | Symbol | Behavior |
| -------- | ------ | -------- |
| `PIPE` | &#124; | stdout of segment N becomes stdin of segment N+1 |
| `AND` | `&&` | Segment N+1 runs only if segment N succeeded (exit code 0) |
| `OR` | `\|\|` | Segment N+1 runs only if segment N failed (exit code ≠ 0) |
| `SEMICOLON` | `;` | Segment N+1 always runs regardless of exit code |

---

### Command Execution with Piping and Redirection

All 35 commands follow the same implementation pattern:

1. Parse flags and arguments from `args[]`.
2. Determine input source: file arguments take priority over piped `stdin`.
3. Call VFS methods on `session.getVfs()`.
4. Catch `VfsException` → return `CommandResult.error(...)`.
5. Return `CommandResult.success(output)`.

The following activity diagram shows the input resolution logic for commands that support both file arguments and piped stdin (e.g., `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`):

![Input Resolution Activity Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/InputResolutionActivity.puml)

**Input redirection** (`<`) is handled by the execution engine before command execution: if a segment has an `inputRedirect` file, the engine reads that file's content from the VFS and passes it as `stdin` to the command.

---

### Alias Resolution and Variable Expansion

**Aliases** allow users to define shortcuts for commonly used commands (e.g., `alias ll='ls -la'`). The alias system is implemented in `ShellSession`:

- Aliases are stored in a `LinkedHashMap<String, String>` within `ShellSession`.
- Before each command lookup, `resolveAlias()` repeatedly resolves the command name through the alias map. A visited set prevents infinite loops from circular alias definitions.
- Aliases persist only within the current shell session and are not saved across restarts.

**Variable expansion** supports a limited set of shell variables:

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| `$USER` | `user` |
| `$HOME` | `/home/user` |
| `$PWD` | Current working directory |
| `$?` | Exit code of the last command |

Variables inside single-quoted strings are not expanded (single-quoted tokens are marked with a `\0` prefix during tokenization). The `expandVariablesInString()` method scans each argument character-by-character, recognises `$` followed by an alphanumeric name or `?`, and substitutes the resolved value.


---

### Glob Expansion

Glob patterns (`*` and `?`) in command arguments are expanded against the VFS before the command receives them:

1. **Detection:** Each argument is checked for `*` or `?` characters. Single-quoted tokens (marked with a `\0` prefix) skip expansion entirely.
2. **Matching:** For patterns without a path separator (e.g., `*.txt`), only immediate children of the current directory are matched. For patterns with path separators (e.g., `/home/*.txt`), `VirtualFileSystem.findByName()` searches the specified subtree.
3. **Fallback:** If no VFS paths match a glob pattern, the literal pattern is passed through unchanged (standard shell behaviour).

Matching uses `VirtualFileSystem.matchesWildcard()`, which converts `*` → `.*` and `?` → `.` to build a regex.


---

### Command Suggestion ("Did you mean?")

When a command name is not found in the registry, `ShellSession.suggestCommand()` computes the Levenshtein edit distance between the mistyped input and every registered command name using dynamic programming. If the closest match has an edit distance ≤ 2, a hint like `Did you mean 'ls'?` is displayed alongside the error.

---

### VFS Environment Persistence

Users can save and load VFS snapshots through the `save`, `load`, `reset`, `envlist`, and `envdelete` commands. The `VfsSerializer` handles the conversion.

**Save/Load flow:**

![Save Load Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/SaveLoadSequence.puml)

**`.env` file format:**

```text
# LinuxLingo Virtual File System Snapshot
# Saved: 2026-03-27T14:30:00
# Working Directory: /home/user
#
# Format: TYPE | PATH | PERMISSIONS | CONTENT

DIR  | /              | rwxr-xr-x
DIR  | /home          | rwxr-xr-x
FILE | /etc/hostname  | rw-r--r-- | linuxlingo
```

Content escaping rules: `\n` → newline, `\|` → literal pipe, `\\` → literal backslash.

---

### Exam Session Flow

The exam module supports three entry modes and three question types.

**Interactive exam flow:**

![Exam Session Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ExamSessionSequence.puml)

#### In-exam control commands (skip / abort)

During an exam run, the user can control the session without exiting the whole application:

- `quit` — **skip** the current (non-PRAC) question and continue to the next.
- `abort` — **terminate** the exam immediately (partial score is shown for attempted questions).

These commands are interpreted centrally by `QuestionInteraction`, not by individual `Question` subclasses. This keeps question types focused on domain logic (`present()` / `checkAnswer(...)`) while the exam UX policy lives in the interaction layer.

**Where the logic lives:**

- `ExamSession.runExam(...)` owns the question loop.
- `QuestionInteraction.presentQuestionWithResult(...)` reads the raw user input and applies the skip/abort policy before grading.
- `ExamResult` accumulates outcomes and can represent a partial run naturally.

**Command handling rules (non-PRAC questions):**

1. If the user types `abort` (case-insensitive), `QuestionInteraction` sets an internal abort flag and signals `ExamSession` to stop iterating.
2. If the user types `quit` (case-insensitive) or input is `null`, the question is recorded as skipped (stored with empty answer and counted as incorrect), and the exam continues.
3. Otherwise, the answer is passed to `Question.checkAnswer(...)` and the result is recorded.

This design prevents control-flow logic from being duplicated across modes (interactive vs direct vs random), since the same `QuestionInteraction` logic is reused.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `quit` and `abort` are handled for **non-PRAC** questions during an exam run:

![Exam session – In-exam control commands (quit / abort)](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ExamControlCommandsSequence.puml)

**PRAC question handling:**

For practical questions, `ExamSession.handlePracQuestion()`:

1. Creates a fresh `VirtualFileSystem` via the `vfsFactory` supplier.
2. Creates a temporary `ShellSession` with this VFS.
3. Calls `tempSession.start()` — the user types shell commands.
4. When the user types `exit`, the temporary session ends.
5. Calls `PracQuestion.checkVfs(tempVfs)` which verifies each `Checkpoint` (expected path + node type, content, or permissions).

---

### Exam Component — Practical Questions

This section documents the configurable VFS setup and richer checkpoint validation features for practical (`PRAC`) questions. The goal is to support more realistic, multi-step shell scenarios while keeping the public Exam API stable for the rest of the system.

The feature is implemented via two extensions:

1. `PracQuestion.SetupItem` — declarative VFS setup instructions applied before the user starts typing commands.
2. Extended `Checkpoint` semantics — new node checks (`NOT_EXISTS`, `CONTENT_EQUALS`, `PERM`) to validate more aspects of the final VFS state.

These changes are internal to the exam module and transparent to callers such as `ExamSession` and `QuestionBank`.

---

#### 1. Class-Level Design

At a high level, the flow for a `PRAC` question becomes:

 1. `ExamSession` creates a fresh `VirtualFileSystem` via `vfsFactory`.
 2. `ExamSession` starts a temporary `ShellSession` over the fresh VFS and lets the user perform the task.
 3. When the user exits the shell, `PracQuestion.checkVfs()` verifies all `Checkpoint`s against the final VFS state.

The feature is implemented by extending the existing `PracQuestion` and `Checkpoint` classes; no new top-level types are introduced.

**Key classes (Exam sub-package):**

- `PracQuestion` (in `linuxlingo.exam.question`)
  - Represents a practical question, with:
    - `List<Checkpoint> checkpoints`
    - `List<SetupItem> setupItems`
  - `applySetup(VirtualFileSystem vfs)` is fully implemented using `setupItems`.

- `PracQuestion.SetupItem` (inner static class)
  - Declared with:
    - `SetupType` enum: `MKDIR`, `FILE`, `PERM`
    - Fields: `type`, `path`, `value`
  - Concrete semantics for each `SetupType` are implemented in `applySetup`.

- `Checkpoint` (in `linuxlingo.exam`)
  - Exposes `matches(VirtualFileSystem vfs)` and `NodeType` enum.
  - Fully supports all `NodeType`s:
    - `DIR` — assert that a directory exists.
    - `FILE` — assert that a file exists.
    - `NOT_EXISTS` — assert that a path is absent.
    - `CONTENT_EQUALS` — assert file content equality.
    - `PERM` — assert file/dir permissions.

- `ExamSession` (in `linuxlingo.exam`)
  - Orchestrates `PRAC` questions via `handlePracQuestion(PracQuestion q)`.
  - Current: creates a fresh VFS, starts a temp shell, then checks the final VFS (`q.checkVfs(tempVfs)`).
  - Not yet wired: calling `q.applySetup(tempVfs)` before starting the `ShellSession`.

This keeps the public interface between modules unchanged: the CLI, Shell, and Storage components continue to treat the Exam module as a black box that exposes `ExamSession` and `QuestionBank` only.

---

#### 5. Rationale and Alternatives

**Why introduce `SetupItem`?**

- Many realistic shell exercises require a non-trivial starting state (pre-existing directories, files, permissions).
- Encoding the initial environment directly in `VirtualFileSystem` from outside the exam module would tightly couple Exam to VFS internals.
- `SetupItem` provides a small, declarative DSL for “what the environment should look like before the user starts”, which is:
  - Easy to generate from question bank text via `QuestionParser`.
  - Easy to reason about and test at the `PracQuestion` level.

#### Why extend `Checkpoint.NodeType`?

- Existing `DIR` and `FILE` checks only validate presence and node kind.
- New types enable richer questions:
  - `NOT_EXISTS`: “Remove this file/directory.”
  - `CONTENT_EQUALS`: “Edit a file to contain specific content.”
  - `PERM`: “Set the permission of this file to 755.”
- This keeps the final-state validation declarative and human-readable in the question bank.

#### Alternative 1: Global VFS Templates

One alternative was to define named “VFS templates” elsewhere (e.g., serialized trees stored by the Storage component), and let `PracQuestion` refer to them by ID.

- **Pros:**
  - Reuse complex environments across multiple questions.
  - Potentially faster to load via `VfsSerializer`.
- **Cons:**
  - Introduces a tight coupling between Exam and Storage/VFS serialization.
  - Makes individual questions harder to understand without looking up the template definition.
- **Reason rejected:** For this project scale, per-question declarative setup keeps the exam bank self-contained and easier for new contributors to maintain.

#### Alternative 2: Hard-coded Setup per Question

Another option was to provide a dedicated subclass or factory per practical question that mutates the VFS imperatively.

- **Pros:**
  - Maximum flexibility (any arbitrary VFS mutation is possible).
- **Cons:**
  - Scales poorly — new questions require new Java code.
  - Blurs separation between content (questions) and logic (exam engine).
- **Reason rejected:** Conflicts with the existing question-bank-driven design, where content lives in `.txt` files, not in code.

---

#### 6. Impact on Other Components

- **CLI Component**
  - No changes required. The `exam` command continues to delegate to `ExamSession`, which hides all internal PRAC details.

- **Shell Component**
  - No public API changes; `ShellSession` is still created with a `VirtualFileSystem` and `Ui`.
  - Only observable difference is that the initial VFS contents for a `PRAC` question may now be non-empty.

- **Storage Component**
  - `QuestionParser` parses additional fields for `PRAC` question setup, constructing the appropriate `SetupItem` instances.
  - No changes are required in `Storage` itself.

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests can construct `PracQuestion` instances with explicit `setupItems` and `checkpoints`, then run:
    - `applySetup(vfs)`
    - mutate `vfs` as if a user had run commands
    - assert on `checkVfs(vfs)` results
  - This isolates exam logic from the interactive shell during automated testing.

---

#### 7. Extension Points

This design leaves room for future growth:

- **Additional `SetupType` values** (e.g., `COPY`, `MOVE`) can be added without modifying existing question banks.
- **Additional `NodeType` values** can be introduced to validate more sophisticated conditions (e.g., ownership, timestamps).
- A future version could allow **difficulty-based setup** (e.g., more complex initial states for `HARD` questions) by inspecting `difficulty` within `applySetup`.

### Question Parsing and Loading

This section explains how question bank files under `data/questions/` are converted into in-memory `Question` objects.

#### Design overview

At runtime, question data flows through the pipeline below:

1. **`QuestionBank.load(Path directory)`** enumerates `.txt` files in the questions directory via `Storage.listFiles(...)`.
2. For each file, **`QuestionParser.parseFile(Path file)`** reads the file, converts each valid line into a concrete `Question`, and returns a `List<Question>`.
3. `QuestionBank` stores the resulting `List<Question>` under a **topic key** derived from the filename (e.g., `navigation.txt` → `"navigation"`).
4. `ExamSession` later requests questions by topic via `questionBank.getQuestions(topic, count, random)`.

**Data flow:**

![Question Parsing Activity Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/QuestionParsingActivity.puml)

---

#### File and line format

Each non-empty, non-comment line in a question bank file is expected to be pipe-delimited with **up to 6 fields**:

```text
TYPE | DIFFICULTY | QUESTION_TEXT | ANSWER | OPTIONS | EXPLANATION
```

`QuestionParser` trims fields and normalises `TYPE`/`DIFFICULTY` before constructing the corresponding question object.

| Field | Meaning | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TYPE` | `MCQ`, `FITB`, or `PRAC` | Dispatch to `parseMcq` / `parseFitb` / `parsePrac` |
| `DIFFICULTY` | `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD` | Stored on `Question` object; used for display/filtering |
| `QUESTION_TEXT` | Prompt shown to user | `Question.present()` |
| `ANSWER` | Correct answer (format depends on type) | `checkAnswer(...)` or `Checkpoint` list |
| `OPTIONS` | Type-specific extra data | MCQ options / PRAC setup items |
| `EXPLANATION` | Shown after grading | `Question.getExplanation()` |

---

#### Type-specific parsing rules

The following diagrams zoom in on the MCQ/FITB-specific parsing and model structure:

![MCQ/FITB Line Parsing Activity Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/McqFitbLineParsingActivity.puml)

![Question Models (MCQ/FITB) Class Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/QuestionModelsMcqFitbClassDiagram.puml)

##### MCQ

- **Answer format**: a single letter, e.g. `B`.
- **Options format**: `A:text B:text C:text D:text`.
- Parsed into `LinkedHashMap<Character, String>` to preserve display order in `McqQuestion.present()`.

**Parsing logic (exact implementation)**

MCQ lines are handled by `QuestionParser.parseMcq(...)`.

1. **Answer validation**
   - The `ANSWER` field is trimmed.
   - If the trimmed answer is blank, parsing fails with `IllegalArgumentException("MCQ answer must not be blank")`.
2. **Options parsing**
   - The `OPTIONS` field is trimmed and split using the regex:
     - `(?=[A-D]:)`
   - Each split segment is then trimmed and interpreted as:
     - `letter ':' text`
   - Only segments where `segment.length() >= 2` and `segment.charAt(1) == ':'` are accepted.
   - The option map key is `segment.charAt(0)` and the value is `segment.substring(2).trim()`.
3. **Options validation**
   - If no valid options are parsed, parsing fails with `IllegalArgumentException("MCQ options must not be empty")`.
4. **Correct answer must exist in options**
   - The correct answer character is taken as `answer.charAt(0)`.
   - It is uppercased for the lookup: `Character.toUpperCase(correctAnswer)`.
   - If the resulting letter is not a key in the parsed options map, parsing fails with
     `IllegalArgumentException("MCQ correct answer not found in options")`.

**How invalid MCQ entries are handled**

`QuestionParser.parseFile(...)` catches `RuntimeException` thrown from `parseMcq(...)`.
If parsing fails, the line is **skipped** (with a logged warning) and the parser continues loading subsequent lines.

Example line:

```text
MCQ | EASY | Which command prints the current directory? | B | A:cd B:pwd C:ls D:dir | 'pwd' stands for ...
```

##### FITB

- **Answer format**: one or more accepted answers.
- `QuestionParser` splits answers and stores them in a `List<String>` used by `FitbQuestion.checkAnswer(...)`.
- Escaping (notably `\|`) is handled so authors can include literal pipes in answer text.

**Parsing logic (exact implementation)**

FITB lines are handled by `QuestionParser.parseFitb(...)`.

1. **Splitting into accepted answers**
   - The raw `ANSWER` field is split using the regex:
     - `(?<!\\)\|`
     - i.e., split on `|` that is **not** preceded by a backslash (`\`).
2. **Trimming and unescaping**
   - Each split part is processed as:
     - `acceptedAnswer.trim().replace("\\|", "|")`
   - Empty strings after trimming are ignored.
3. **Accepted-answer list must be non-empty**
   - If the resulting `List<String>` is empty, parsing fails with:
     - `IllegalArgumentException("FITB accepted answer list must not be empty")`.

**Authoring notes (important for validation)**

- Accepted answers are compared as an **exact string match after trimming**.
  - `FitbQuestion.checkAnswer(...)` uses `acceptedAnswers.contains(answer.trim())`.
  - This means the match is **case-sensitive** unless the question bank explicitly provides variants (e.g., `pwd|PWD`).
- If an accepted answer itself needs to contain a literal `|` character, it must be escaped as `\|` in the bank.

**How invalid FITB entries are handled**

As with MCQ, any `RuntimeException` thrown while parsing a FITB entry causes the line to be **skipped** (with a logged warning).

---

#### Runtime answer input validation (MCQ/FITB)

This section documents how user input is validated during an exam run. It is separate from question-bank parsing.

The following sequence diagram shows the end-to-end interaction when a user answers an MCQ/FITB question (including reprompts, skip, and abort behavior):

![MCQ/FITB Answer Interaction Sequence Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/McqFitbAnswerInteractionSequence.puml)

**Where it happens**

- `ExamSession` delegates non-PRAC question attempts to `QuestionInteraction`.
- `QuestionInteraction.presentQuestionWithResult(...)` selects the appropriate input routine based on the runtime type:
  - `McqQuestion` -> `askValidatedMcqAnswer(...)`
  - `FitbQuestion` -> `askValidatedFitbAnswer(...)`

**MCQ input validation (`askValidatedMcqAnswer`)**

- The question is printed once, then the user is repeatedly prompted for `Your answer:` until a valid input is entered.
- The following inputs are treated as control commands:
  - `quit` (case-insensitive): skip the question
  - `abort` (case-insensitive): abort the entire exam
- Otherwise, the input is valid only if:
  - after trimming it is exactly **one character**, and
  - that character (uppercased) is in the range **A-D**.
- A valid MCQ input is normalized to uppercase (i.e., returns `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, or `"D"`).

**FITB input validation (`askValidatedFitbAnswer`)**

- The question is printed once, then the user is repeatedly prompted for `Your answer:`.
- The same control commands are supported:
  - `quit` (case-insensitive): skip the question
  - `abort` (case-insensitive): abort the entire exam
- Otherwise, the input is valid only if it is **non-empty after trimming**.
- The original user input is returned (not the trimmed version). Grading later trims it again.

**Grading logic (`checkAnswer`)**

- MCQ grading is implemented in `McqQuestion.checkAnswer(String)`:
  - trims user answer
  - requires length 1
  - normalizes to uppercase
  - checks it is within A-D
  - compares it to the stored `correctAnswer`
- FITB grading is implemented in `FitbQuestion.checkAnswer(String)`:
  - trims user answer
  - checks membership in `acceptedAnswers` (case-sensitive)

**Skip/abort handling**

- If the user input is `abort`, `QuestionInteraction` sets an internal `examAborted` flag, prints `Exam aborted.`, and stops the run.
- If the user input is `quit` or the UI returns `null`, the question is considered **skipped**:
  - `ExamResult.addResult(question, "", false)` is recorded (empty stored answer, incorrect)

 Example line:

```text
FITB | EASY | To print the current directory: ___ | pwd|PWD | | pwd prints the current working directory.
```

##### PRAC

- **Answer format**: comma-separated checkpoints, each describing an expected VFS state.
- Each checkpoint becomes a `Checkpoint` object used by `PracQuestion.checkVfs(vfs)`.

Checkpoint examples (illustrative):

- Existence/type: `/home/project:DIR`, `/home/readme.txt:FILE`
- Non-existence: `/tmp/junk:NOT_EXISTS`
- Content: `/home/readme.txt:CONTENT_EQUALS=hello`
- Permission: `/home/secret.txt:PERM=rwxr-x---`

PRAC also supports an optional **setup list** in the `OPTIONS` field (semicolon-separated), which is parsed into `PracQuestion.SetupItem` objects for `PracQuestion.applySetup(vfs)`.

---

#### Error handling and robustness

`QuestionParser` is intentionally forgiving:

- **Malformed lines** are skipped (with a logged warning) rather than failing the entire file.
- **Invalid difficulty values** are normalised (defaulting to a safe value) so contributors can iterate quickly on content without breaking the app.
- `QuestionBank.load(...)` skips empty question banks and continues loading other files so one bad topic does not take down the full exam feature.

This matches the project’s goal of allowing question banks to be edited by non-developers without requiring perfect formatting.

---

#### Rationale and alternatives

**Why a pipe-delimited text format (instead of JSON/YAML)?**

- Easy to edit in any text editor.
- Diff-friendly in version control.
- Minimal syntax overhead for simple question banks.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Embedding questions in Java code**: rejected because it couples content to implementation and makes non-developer contributions difficult.
- **Using JSON/YAML**: rejected due to added verbosity and higher risk of syntax errors for casual contributors.
- **A more complex DSL**: rejected because it increases parser complexity and maintenance cost.

---

### Resource Extraction on First Run

`ResourceExtractor` ensures that bundled question bank files are available on disk.

![Resource Extraction Activity Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T10-2/tp/master/docs/diagrams/ResourceExtractionActivity.puml)

This design respects user customizations — once the questions directory exists, bundled resources are never overwritten. The five bundled question files cover: `file-management`, `navigation`, `permissions`, `piping-redirection`, and `text-processing`.

## Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Portability:** Should work on any mainstream OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) with Java 17 or above installed.
2. **Performance:** All shell commands should execute in under 100ms. VFS operations should handle file systems with up to 1000 nodes without noticeable lag.
3. **Usability:** A user familiar with basic Linux commands should be able to use the shell simulator without consulting documentation.
4. **Reliability:** The application should handle all invalid inputs gracefully (no crashes) and provide descriptive error messages.
5. **Testability:** All components should be unit-testable in isolation. The `Ui` class accepts injectable I/O streams for test harness use.
6. **Data Integrity:** VFS snapshots saved to disk must be losslessly restorable. Escaping rules must preserve file content containing newlines, pipes, and backslashes.
7. **Single-user:** The application is designed for single-user use and does not need to handle concurrent access.

   - `cd ~` → navigates to `/home/user`
   - `ls -la` → lists files with permissions, types, and sizes

3. **File and directory operations**
   - `mkdir testdir` → no output (success)
   - `mkdir -p a/b/c` → creates nested directories
   - `ls` → `testdir` appears in listing
   - `touch testdir/hello.txt` → no output (success)
   - `echo "Hello World" > testdir/hello.txt` then `cat testdir/hello.txt` → `Hello World`
   - `cp testdir/hello.txt testdir/copy.txt` → file copied
   - `mv testdir/copy.txt testdir/moved.txt` → file renamed
   - `rm -r testdir` → directory and contents removed

4. **Piping**
   - `echo "line1" | cat` → `line1`
   - `echo "apple" | grep apple` → `apple`

5. **Output redirection**
   - `echo "test output" > /tmp/out.txt` then `cat /tmp/out.txt` → `test output`
   - `echo "more" >> /tmp/out.txt` then `cat /tmp/out.txt` → `test output` followed by `more`

6. **Input redirection**
   - `echo "hello" > /tmp/in.txt` then `cat < /tmp/in.txt` → `hello`
   - `grep hello < /tmp/in.txt` → `hello`

7. **Conditional execution**
   - `echo success && echo "also runs"` → both `success` and `also runs` printed
   - `ls /nonexistent && echo "no"` → error message only, `no` is NOT printed
   - `ls /nonexistent || echo "fallback"` → error message, then `fallback` printed
   - `echo a ; echo b` → both `a` and `b` printed on separate lines

8. **Text processing**
   - `echo "hello world" > /tmp/test.txt` then `grep hello /tmp/test.txt` → `hello world`

   - `sort` / `uniq` / `head` / `tail` — verify expected output on multi-line input

9. **Permissions**
   - `touch /tmp/secret.txt` then `chmod 000 /tmp/secret.txt` then `cat /tmp/secret.txt` → `Permission denied` error

10. **Glob patterns**
    - `touch a.txt b.txt c.log` then `ls *.txt` → lists `a.txt b.txt` only
    - `ls ?.txt` → lists `a.txt b.txt` (single-character match)

11. **Shell variables**
    - `echo $USER` → `user`
    - `echo $HOME` → `/home/user`
    - `echo $PWD` → current working directory

12. **Aliases**

    - `unalias ll` then `ll` → `ll: command not found`

13. **Command history**
    - Run a few commands, then `history` → numbered list of previous commands
    - `history 3` → shows the last 3 commands
    - `history -c` → clears the command history

14. **Info commands**
    - `man ls` → displays usage info for `ls`
    - `tree` → displays directory tree from current directory

15. **Diff and tee**
    - `echo "a" > /tmp/f1.txt` and `echo "b" > /tmp/f2.txt` then `diff /tmp/f1.txt /tmp/f2.txt` → shows differences
    - `echo "hello" | tee /tmp/tee.txt` → prints `hello` AND writes it to `/tmp/tee.txt`

16. **Command suggestion**
    - `mkdi` → `mkdi: command not found` followed by `Did you mean 'mkdir'?`
    - `gre` → `gre: command not found` followed by `Did you mean 'grep'?`

17. **Exiting the shell**
    - `exit` → returns to `linuxlingo>` prompt
